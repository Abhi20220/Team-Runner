# Team-Runner

## Goals
My team built this application because the client wanted an app where they are able to track a users distance from their intial destination to their final destination, resulting in a 'x km' has been traveled. This is done while the user is apart of a team where the following elements are shown:

```
1. My run (your individual run distance)
2. My Team (your teams run distance)
3. My goal (how many km/month)
4. Graphs (line graph and team distance graph)
```


## Problems and Solutions
There were many problems that were faced with our team-runner project. The primary problem was involved with using git. Mainly  pushing and merging code. A problem that arose from this was that when trying to merge code with a collaborators code, it would be very time consuming due to merge conflicts. 

We also ran into a problem where merging deleted our main code, so we had to revert the changes and work around the merge by deleting our local repo and git cloning the main.
